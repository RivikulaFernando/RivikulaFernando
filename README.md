<h1 align="center">Sahan Tharuka Cooray</h1>

I'm a second-year Biomedical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa, driven by a passion to blend healthcare with innovation. My key interests include signal-centric prosthetics, EMG-based prosthetic control, human-computer interaction (HCI), and 3D-printed assistive solution design. I specialize in designing custom prosthetics and orthotics using Computer Aided Design tools with a holistic desire, aiming for precise, patient-specific modeling.

As a co-founder of Bionics for Everyone (Bio4E), a multidisciplinary visionary startup founded by UoM undergraduates, I lead our mission-driven initiative. In my work here, we launched an initiative to provide affordable, high-performance prosthetic and orthotic (P&O) devices for under-resourced communities in Sri Lanka. By collaborating with occupational therapists, we aim to deliver meaningful low-cost assistive solutions and empower people with physical challenges across the country. My mission is to bridge the gap between advanced biomedical technology and the real-world needs of patients.
